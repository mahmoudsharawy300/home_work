//Design an OOP model for planning trip fuel across multiple vehicle types.
//Requirements:
//- Provide a general vehicle type with encapsulated core data (private fields) and validated constructors
//(invalid â†’ print an error; keep previous values).
//- Create at least two specialized vehicle types that inherit from the general type and introduce one
//private field each affecting fuel usage, with validation.
//- Define a fuel computation method in the general type; specialized types must override it with their own
//rule.
//- In a mixed collection of vehicles, given a list of trip distances, compute total fuel per vehicle and print
//which vehicles cannot complete the route under their own constraints (you define the constraint per
//type).
